## Greetings!

You can find the source for this file in your `_posts` directory. You can add new markdown files to the `_posts` directory, and
when your site is rebuilt by GitHub (this takes about 10 minutes), your new post will be visible.

## Naming your posts
When naming your posts, you should use the following format: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown.

## Using markdown

You can use markdown to easily format your posts. Here are some examples for you:

### section headers

- unordered
- lists

1. ordered
2. lists

*italic text*

**bold text**

[named web links](http://techuphq.com)

[referenced web links][techuphq]

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def say_howdy(name)
  puts "Howdy, #{name}!"
end
print_howdy('Parter')
#=> prints 'Howdy, Partner!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
