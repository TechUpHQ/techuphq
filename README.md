TechUp HQ GitHub Pages Site Template
====

Tech event planners need great websites and this template is here to help get them started. If you are an event planner on TechUp HQ, this site is automatically forked into your account when you enable GitHub integration. GitHub then takes over and uses Jekyll to build your site. GitHub Pages will host your site at: http://yourgithubusername.github.io/techuphq


Features

- Blogging
- Customizable Themes
- Picasa Photo Albums


Customization
----

This site is extremely easy to customize. View the _config.yml file for customization options. Once you edit the _config.yml file, GitHub will rebuild your site in about 10 minutes and you will see your changes take effect. For advanced users, you can checkout your site and edit anything you want.
